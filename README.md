GeoSync extension
=================

This extension will fetch details from the Google API for partial addresses.

At the mment it looks for pharmacies in the netherlands.

Details include latitude, longitude, name, phonenumber, website.

It's still a bit fuzzy around the edges - so not all addresses resolve correctly, and sometimes a pharmacy a few hunded meters next to the given address is found.
